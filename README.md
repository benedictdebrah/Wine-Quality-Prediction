# Wine Quality Prediction
#I am trying
 ## Business Understanding
As a machine learning expert, I have been engaged by a prestigious wine producer to develop a predictive model that accurately determines the quality of newly produced wine bottles based on sensor readings collected during the production process. With an annual production of over 200,000 bottles of both red and white wine, it is imperative for the company to maintain its high reputation by identifying errors and ensuring consistent quality in its product.

The company has provided a dataset that includes the average quality scores of over 1,500 randomly sampled wine bottles, as rated by 5 different experts on a scale of 1 to 10, along with associated sensor readings for features such as alcohol content, pH, citric acid content, and other relevant metrics.

## Sucess Criteria
To meet the business objectives, it is imperative for the predictive model to deliver highly accurate results, with a maximum deviation of **0.5 points from the true quality score**. This is crucial for the company to accurately separate its finest quality wines for distribution to investors and subscription customers.
